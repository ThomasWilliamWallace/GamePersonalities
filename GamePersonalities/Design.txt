Motive system:
Characters have a number of strategic 'moves' they can make, such as:
Ambush, recruit ally to attack, lure to betrayal, join ally to attack
These moves can either have hardcoded triggers, or can have an expected effect and be used in a search/planning algorithm (which should
be used for a plan of multiple steps).

The moves taken will depend on the characters motives.

 Guard and ambush behaviour used as part of the faction strategy
 Has to have a motivation / payoff (ie resource in the room being guarded, or a reason to capture/attack an enemy. This can be provided by missions.)
 Use a director system to pulse the missions/conflict drivers, with waves of increasing difficulty.
 
 Flavour- people can invite you to 'go to the gym together' or suchlike.
 
 Guards should be able to punish with toilet cleaning duty? Gangs may have other punishments. They may take your food.
